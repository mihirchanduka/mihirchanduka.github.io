          Welcome to the world wide web homepage of Mihir Chanduka.

        <p>
          I'm a student at Rutgers studying Computer Science and Economics, building things at the intersection of software, systems, and curiosity. I've designed anti-cheat engines, simulated EKGs, taught kids to code, built racecar data systems, and spun up home servers just for fun.

         I've interned at Rotikaa Foods, optimizing inventory systems with Python, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL. Before that, I taught at Code Ninjas, developed data tools for Student Formula Racing, and led an electrical team to the global finals of FRC with an AI-powered device for the visually impaired.

          I'm fascinated by deep learning, embedded systems, and clever ways tech can make the world more understandable. I believe the best builders are always learningâ€”and that play is a form of research.
